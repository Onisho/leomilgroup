Leomil and eOne/License Connection teamed up for a moonlit adventure with superhero PJ Masks shoes! The preschool hit follows the exciting night time adventures of three friends. By day they go to school like every other kid, but at night their superhero work begins. Once the sun goes down, they put on their pyjamas or PJâ€™s and become Catboy, Owlette and Gekko! A third season is in development thanks to the international high ratings on Disney Channel and Disney Junior. First toys hit the shelves in 2017 broadly. Leomil is happy to follow its way, into the night to save the day with a PJ Masks footwear collection in Winter 2018!
