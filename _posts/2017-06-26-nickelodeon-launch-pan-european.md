Nickelodeon and Leomil are delighted to announce an international children’s footwear partnership for Shimmer and Shine, one of Nickelodeon’s hit animated preschool series. The multi-year licensing agreement covers several markets in Europe, Middle-East and Russia. The sparkling Shimmer and Shine license stands out in Leomil’s current portfolio as new girls’ property, and Leomil is developing a range of glitzy, playful footwear, presenting a new type of shoes within Leomil’s diverse portfolio. Time to shine with this new collection from early Winter 2018 onwards!
