"The new dolls are groundbreaking in two ways. First of all, their bendable joints and athletic outfits were designed to showcase the comic book heroes’ physical powers rather than their sex appeal. 
Think more crime-busting, fewer bustiers. That stands in contrast to other iterations of female superhero dolls, like the scantily clad Wonder Woman Barbie."
"But unlike traditional action figures, the new dolls have fabric clothes and soft hair that can be brushed and styled like Barbie’s. 
In other words, they represent a hybrid toy that can appeal to fashionista doll lovers and feminist comic book fans alike." 
Promising future for DC Superhero Girls!
